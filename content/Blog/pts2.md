## ⚡ How Gas Thermoelectric Plants Work

1. **Gas is burned** → produces heat  
2. **Heat generates steam**  
3. **Steam spins turbines**  
4. **Turbines generate electricity**

## 🔧 Combined Cycle: The Efficiency Breakthrough  
The **Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT)** plant uses both gas and steam turbines together.

- Typical coal plant efficiency: **33%**
- Modern CCGT efficiency: **55–62%**
