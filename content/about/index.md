## Who am i?

<img class="image-left-250" src="/images/yo2.jpeg"> My name is Jose, I am 28 years old. I was born and raised in Barranquilla, Colombia, a city I love and where I plan to live my whole life...

I've been playing volleyball since I was 14. It's a sport that has taught me much of what I know about life today, and has taken me to more than 20 countries around the world.

### Academic Life

<img class="image-right-250" src="/images/yo.HEIC">I attended high school in Barranquilla, Colombia, at the Escuela Normal Superior La Hacienda. My education there focused on pedagogy and teaching.

Afterward, I graduated from the <a href="https://www.uac.edu.co/pregrado/ingenieria-mecatronica/" target="_blank">Universidad Autónoma del Caribe </a> with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering, where I developed a passion for industrial automation and robotics.


### Work History

1. <a href="https://www.lenovo.com" target="_blank"> Lenovo  </a>.

I remotely provided support for computers under warranty. Thanks to my good performance, they promoted me to the customer satisfaction survey department, where I worked remotely with teams from different parts of the world to improve the company's customer service.

2. <a href="https://www.petromil.com" target="_blank"> Petromil Gas </a>.

I started by providing consumption reports for gas stations and was promoted to sales agent for the gas division, selling to major power generators in Colombia. I was with that company for about two years, where I was recognized for my excellent work in finding commercial and strategic partners for the company's growth.

Currently, I am working for the same company, but as an external consultant.
