# Site Enhancement!
To improve user experience on my website, I added several interactive areas and tools that make navigation and content use easier. Among these enhancements are:

1. **Interactive calculators**: These tools allow users to perform calculations immediately without leaving the page. For example, I implemented a commission calculator and another for summing the daily counted checks.

2. **Multimedia content areas**: I integrated educational and demonstration videos using YouTube links directly on the page. This allows users to learn or see practical examples while browsing, making the experience more dynamic.

3. **Interactive sections**: Some sections of the site have buttons and menus that change content instantly, avoiding page reloads and improving navigation fluidity.

These improvements make the site not only informative but also practical and engaging for visitors, encouraging interaction and the use of the tools provided.
