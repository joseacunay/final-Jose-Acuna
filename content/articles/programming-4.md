# Role of AI in the Website!
During the development of my website, artificial intelligence played an important supportive role in certain areas, but with notable limitations:

1. **Error detection**: AI was very helpful in quickly identifying code errors. For example, when the code didn't compile or there were script conflicts, AI could suggest possible solutions or indicate which lines caused the issues.

2. **Finding solutions**: Another key benefit was helping me locate existing methods or functions that solved specific problems, saving time from manually searching through documentation.

3. **Limitations**: However, when asked to generate complete code from scratch, AI often produced incomplete or error-prone results. This means its role is more of an assistant rather than a full replacement in website development.

In summary, AI is a powerful tool for improving efficiency and quickly detecting problems, but it does not replace human expertise and oversight in building a functional, error-free website.
